# Breadth first search algorithm

# Breadth First Search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.
# The algorithm starts at the root node and explores all the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.
# layer-by-layer approach
