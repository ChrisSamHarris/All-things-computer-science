# Depth First Search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.
# The algorithm starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

# The time complexity of the DFS algorithm is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.
