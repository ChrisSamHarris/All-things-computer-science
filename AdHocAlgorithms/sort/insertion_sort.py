# good choice in a dataset that is nearly sorted, but a poor choice where the dataset is reversed 

# Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by iteratively inserting each element of an unsorted list 
# into its correct position in a sorted portion of the list. It is a stable sorting algorithm, 
# meaning that elements with equal values maintain their relative order in the sorted output.

# Insertion sort is like sorting playing cards in your hands. You split the cards into two groups: 
# the sorted cards and the unsorted cards. 
# Then, you pick a card from the unsorted group and put it in the right place in the sorted group.
