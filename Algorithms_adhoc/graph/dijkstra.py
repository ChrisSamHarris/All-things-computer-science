# dijkstras algorith
# Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph.
# finds the shortwst path from a source node to all other nodes in the graph, ussing the weight of the edges to find the path
# that minimises the total weight between the source node and all other nodes
