# In numerical analysis, Newton's method, is a root-finding algorithm which produces 
# successively better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function.
# The most basic version starts with a real-valued function f,
# its derivative fâ€², and an initial guess x0 for a root of f.
